# Linux configuration files used by me
Contains the configuration files used in my Linux system. I use tmux alongside vim. I also use the bash shell. 

- Tmux is configured in a away that makes it easy to work alongside vim.
- In vim I have some plugins that help me in the coding process.
- In bash I have some useful alias that help me increase my productivity.
